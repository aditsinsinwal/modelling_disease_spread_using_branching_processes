# modelling_disease_spread_using_branching_processes
Branching processes are mathematical models that describe how populations evolve over time.
Originally used to model the extinction of family names, these processes have applications in biology (population genetics), epidemiology (disease spread), and even in social networks (spread of information or rumors).

In this project, we will use branching processes to model the spread of an epidemic. 
This is particularly relevant for understanding how diseases propagate through populations, which can inform public health interventions.

Real-Life Application
The project can be framed as modeling the spread of a contagious disease (like the flu, COVID-19, etc.) within a population. 
The key question is to understand under what conditions the disease will die out (extinction) or become an epidemic (uncontrolled spread).
